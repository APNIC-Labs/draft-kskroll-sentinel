    <abstract>
      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin
      authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital
      signatures. These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain
      of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a
      particular node in the DNS. This document specifies a mechanism that
      will allow an end user to establish the trusted key state of the
      resolvers that handle the user's DNS queries. This allows users to
      discover the trusted key state used by their DNS resolution service.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref target="RFC4033"/>", <xref
      target="RFC4034"/> and <xref target="RFC4035"/> were developed to
      provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by
      using digital signatures. DNSSEC uses Key Tags to efficiently match
      signatures to the keys from which they are generated. The Key Tag is a
      16-bit value computed from the RDATA portion of a DNSKEY RR using a
      formula not unlike a ones-complement checksum. RRSIG RRs contain a Key
      Tag field whose value is equal to the Key Tag of the DNSKEY RR that
      validates the signature.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how validating resolvers should respond to
      certain queries so that a user can deduce whether a key has been loaded
      into a resolver's trusted key store. This mechanism can be used to
      determine whether a certain Root Zone KSK is ready to be used as a
      trusted key within the context of a key roll.</t>

      <t>This new mechanism is OPTIONAL to implement and use, although for
      reasons of supporting broad-based measurement techniques, it is strongly
      preferred if configurations of DNSSEC-validating resolvers enabled this
      mechanism by default, allowing for configuration directives to disable
      this mechanism if desired.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Sentinel Mechanism">
      <t>DNSSEC-Validating resolvers that implement this mechanism MUST be
      performing validation of responses in accordance with the DNSSEC
      response validation specification <xref target="RFC4035"/>. The mechanism
      is to be applied only to queries that have the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit set
      and the Checking Disabled (CD) bit cleared, and the query type is
      A or AAAA. In all other cases the mechanism described here is not to
      be applied to the response.</t>

      <t>If the outcome of the DNS response validation process indicates that
      the response is authentic, and if the original query contains exactly
      one label that matches the template ".is-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;.", then
      the following rule should be applied to the response: If the resolver
      has placed a Root Zone Key Signing Key with a tag index value matching the
      value specified in the query into the local resolver's store of trusted
      keys, then the resolver MUST return a response indicating that the
      response contains authenticated data according to section 5.8 of <xref
      target="RFC6840"/>. Otherwise, the resolver MUST return RCODE 2 (server
      failure). Note that the &lt;tag-index&gt; is specified in the DNS label
      using hex notation.</t>

      <t>If the outcome of the DNS response validation process indicates that
      the response is authentic, and if the original query contains exactly
      one label that matches the template ".not-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;.", then
      the following rule should be applied to the response: If the resolver
      has not placed a Root Zone Key Signing Key with a tag index value matching
      the value specified in the query into the local resolver's store of
      trusted keys, then the resolver should return a response indicating that
      the response contains authenticated data according to section 5.8 of
      <xref target="RFC6840"/>. Otherwise, the resolver MUST return RCODE 2
      (server failure). Note that the &lt;tag-index&gt; is specified in the
      DNS label using hex notation.</t>

      <t>If a query contains one instance of both of these query templates
      then the resolver MUST NOT alter the outcome of the DNS response
      validation process, as this query form should not be used as a
      trusted key sentinel query.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Sentinel Processing">
      <t>This proposed test that uses the DNS response mechanism described in
      this document is based on three DNS names that have three distinct DNS
      resolution behaviours. The test is intended to allow a user to determine
      the state of their DNS resolution system, and in particular whether or
      not they are using validating DNS resolvers that have picked up an
      incoming trust anchor in a forthcoming key roll, if that can be
      determined.</t>

      <t>The name format can be defined in a number of ways, and no name form
      is intrinsically better than any other in terms of the test itself. 
      It is assumed that the labels can occur at any point within the domain
      name.</t>

      <t>When validating a response to an A or AAAA query for one of these
      recognised names, a DNSSEC-validating resolver performs an additional
      test following the conventional validation function, and the result of
      this test may change a validated response to a response that indicates
      validation failure.</t>

      <t>The sentinel process is envisaged to use a test with three names:
      </t>

      <t><list style="letters">
          <t>a name containing the label ".is-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;.". This name
          MUST be validly signed.</t>

          <t>a name containing the label ".not-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;.". This name
          MUST be validly signed</t>

          <t>a third name that is signed with a DNSSEC signature. This name MUST be 
          signed, but the signature is to be deliberately altered such that it cannot
          be validated.</t>
        </list>The responses received from queries to resolve each of these
      names would allow us to infer a trust key state of the resolution
      environment.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Case 1: A DNSSEC-Validating resolver that includes this mechanism
          that has loaded the nominated key into its trusted key store will
          respond with an A (or AAAA) record response for "is-ta", SERVFAIL for "not-ta"
          and SERVFAIL for the invalid name.</t>

          <t>Case 2: A DNSSEC-Validating resolver that includes this mechanism
          that has not loaded the nominated key into its trusted key store
          will respond with an SERVFAIL record for "is-ta", an A (or AAAA) record
          response for "not-ta" and SERVFAIL for the invalid name.</t>

          <t>Case 3: A DNSSEC-Validating resolver that does not include this
          mechanism will respond with an A record response for "is-ta", an A (or AAAA)
          record response for "not-ta" and SERVFAIL for the invalid name.</t>

          <t>Case 4: A non-DNSSEC-Validating resolver will respond with an A (or AAAA)
          record response for the "is-ta" queery, the "not-ta" query and
          the DNSSEC-invalid name query.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Given the clear delineation between these three cases, if a client
      directs these three queries to a simple recursive resolver, the variation in
      response to the three queries should allow the client to determine the
      category of the resolver as to whether it supports this mechanism, whether or
      not it has loaded a particular key into its local trusted key store.</t>

      <t>A Case 1 response pattern says that the nominated key is
      trusted by the resolver and has been loaded into its local
      trusted key store. A Case 2 response pattern says that the
      nominated key is not yet trusted by the resolver in its own
      right. A Case 3 response is indeterminate, and a Case 4 response
      indicates that the client does not have a validating
      resolver.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Sentinel Test Result Considerations">
      <t>The description in the previous section describes a simple situation
      where the test queries were being passed to a single recursive resolver who was
      then querying authoritative name servers, including the root servers
      directly.</t>

      <t>A common case is where the end client uses multiple
      resolvers in their local  DNS configuration. In these cases the SERVFAIL responses
      from one resolver will prompt the end client to repeat the query against
      one of the other configured resolvers.</t>

      <t>If any of the client's resolvers are non-validating resolvers, the
      tests will result in the client reporting that it has a non-validating
      DNS environment, which is effectively the case.</t>

      <t>If all of the client resolvers are DNSSEC-validating resolvers, but
      some do not support this trusted key mechanism, then the result will be
      indeterminate with respect to trusted key status. Equally, if all the
      client's resolvers support this mechanism, but some have loaded the key
      into the trusted key store and some have not, then the result is
      indeterminate.</t>

      <t>There is also the case of a resolver using a forwarder.</t>

      <t>If the resolver is non-validating, and it has a single forwarder
      clause, then the resolver will presumably mirror the capabilities of the
      forwarder target resolver. If this non-validating resolver has
      multiple forwarders, then the above considerations cdescribed 
      above will apply.</t>

      <t>If a validating resolver has a forwarding configuration, and uses the
      CD flag on all forwarded queries, then this resolver is acting in a
      manner that is identical to a standalone resolver. The same
      consideration applies if any one one of the forwarder targets is a
      non-validating resolver. Similarly, if all the forwarder targets do not
      apply this trusted key mechanism, the same considerations apply.</t>

      <t>If both the validating resolver and the forwarder support this
      trusted key sentinel mechanism, and the local resolver's queries do not carry the CD bit, and
      the trusted key state differs between the forwarding resolver and the forwarder
      target then either the outcome is indeterminate validating (Case 3), or
      a case of mixed signals (SERVFAIL in all three responses), which is
      also an indeterminate response with respect to the trusted key
      state. It is difficult to understand the rationale for this situation,
      in that a validating recursive resolver is capable of evaluating the 
      authenticity of DNS responses using its own trust material. By clearing the
      CD bit in forwarded queries the local forwarding resolver is not able to
      directly validate the responses relating to those queries where the
      forwarder target is indicating a validation failure.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document describes a mechanism to allow users to determine the
      trust state of root zone key signing keys in the DNS resolution system
      that they use.</t>

      <t>The mechanism does not require resolvers to set otherwise
      unauthenticated responses to be marked as authenticated, and does not
      alter the security properties of DNSSEC with respect to the
      interpretation of the authenticity of responses that are do marked.</t>

      <t>The mechanism does not require any further significant processing of
      DNS responses, and queries of the form described in this document do not
      impose any additional load that could be exploited in an attack over the
      the normal DNSSEC validation processing load.</t>
