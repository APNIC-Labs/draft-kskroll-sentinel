    <abstract>

      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to
      provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS
      data by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can
      be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust
      anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.
      This document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user
      to establish the trusted key state of the resolvers that handle
      the user's DNS queries. This allows users to discover the
      trusted key state used by their DNS resolution service.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <xref
      target="RFC4033"></xref>", <xref target="RFC4034"></xref> and
      <xref target="RFC4035"></xref> were developed to provide origin
      authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using
      digital signatures.  DNSSEC uses Key Tags to efficiently match
      signatures to the keys from which they are generated.  The Key
      Tag is a 16-bit value computed from the RDATA portion of a
      DNSKEY RR using a formula not unlike a ones-complement checksum.
      RRSIG RRs contain a Key Tag field whose value is equal to the
      Key Tag of the DNSKEY RR that validates the signature.</t>

      <t>This document specifies how validating resolvers should
      respond to certain queries so that a user can deduce whether a
      key has been loaded into a resolver's trusted key store.  This
      mechanism can be used to determine whether a certain Root Zone
      KSK is ready to be used as a trusted key within the context of a
      key roll.</t>

      <t>This new mechanism is OPTIONAL to implement and use, although
      for reasons of supporting broad based measurement techniques, it
      is strongly preferred if configurations of DNSSEC-vbalidating
      resolvers enabled this mechanism by default, allowing for
      configuration directives to disable this mechanism if
      desired.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in RFC 2119.</t>

    <section title="Sentinel Mechanism">

      <t>DNSSEC-Validating resolvers that implement this mechanism
      MUST be performing validation of responses in accordance with
      the DNSSEC response validation specification <xref
      target="RFC4035"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If the outcome of the DNS response validation process
      indicates that the response is authentic, and if the original
      query contains exactly one label that matches the template
      ".is-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;.", then the following rule should be
      applied to the response.  If the resolver has placed a Root Zone
      Key Signing Key with tag index value matching the value
      specified in the query into the local resolver's store of
      trusted keys, then the resolver should return a response
      indicatating that the response contains authenticated data
      according to section 5.8 of <xref
      target="RFC6840"></xref>. Otherwise, the resolver MUST return
      RCODE 2 (server failure). Note that the &lt;tag-index&gt; is specified
      in the DNS label using hex notation.</t>

      <t>If the outcome of the DNS response validation process
      indicates that the response is authentic, and if the original
      query contains exactly one label that matches the template
      ".not-ta-&lt;tag-index&gt;.", then the following rule should be
      applied to the response.  If the resolver has not placed a Root
      Zone Key Signing Key with tag index value matching the value
      specified in the query into the local resolver's store of
      trusted keys, then the resolver should return a response
      indicatating that the response contains authenticated data
      according to section 5.8 of <xref
      target="RFC6840"></xref>. Otherwise, the resolver MUST return
      RCODE 2 (server failure). Note that the &lt;tag-index&gt; is specified
      in the DNS label using hex notation.</t>

      <t>If a query contains one instance of both of these query templates
      then the resolver MUST NOT alter the outcome of the DNS response
      validation process.</t>

    <section title="Sentinel Considerations">

       <t>[Text to be added about considerations relating to caching, and resolver forwarding
           partial deployment of the mechanism, as well as any other issues that may arise
           with this mechanism]</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
    
      <t>This document describes a mechanism to allow users to
      determine the trust state of root zone key signing keys in the
      DNS resolutiojn system that they use.</t>

      <t>The mechanism does not require resolvers to set outwise
      unauthenticated responses to be marked as authenticated, and
      does not alter the security properties of DNSSEC with respect to
      the interpretation of the authenticity of responses that are do
      marked.</t>

      <t>The mechanism does not require any further significant
      processing of DNS responses, and queries of the form described
      in this document do not impose any additional load that could be
      exploited in an attack over the the normal DNSSEC validation
      processing load.</t>

    <section title="Acknowledgements">

      <t>This document has borrowed extensively from RFC8145 for the introductory
      text, and the authors would like to acknowledge and thank the authors of
      that document both for some text excerpts and for the more general stimulation
      of thoughts about monitoring the progress of a roll of the Key Signing Key of the
      Root Zone of the DNS.</t>
